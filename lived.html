		<p>When deciding to go to college I had no idea of what I wanted to do.  I had always been good with numbers and was good at math.  However, I was also really interested in History in high school. After a lot of thought, I determined that I wanted to major in Accounting in college.  I was pleased with this decision but in the summer leading up to college I was having second thoughts about accounting as my major.  Sure it would be good money, but it would be the same thing every day once I got a job. I also thought about how technology is gaining a larger role in our society.  Soon everyone will be able to do the things accountants can do, with computer programs.  Nowadays technology is all around us in our lives.  When we interact with technology it can have many influences on our lives.  Throughout my life I have always been around computers and they have always fascinated me. From being around computers so much I decided to change my major to Computer Science.</p>
		<p>When I was young I remember having a toy laptop that my parents had bought me.  I would play with it even though it didn’t even do anything.  This was the first time I remember using a “computer”.  I also had a Gameboy and I always wondered how it worked.  How did these images show up on the screen on this tiny device? Growing up I played video games and I really enjoyed them.  Little did I know that these video game consoles were also computers.   I spent a lot of time on computers from going on AIM instant messenger to playing the “Backyard Sports” computer games.  These video games that I played got me interested in learning how games are made.  So early in High School I took a class called, Game Design.  In this class we learned how to make basic, small games for the computer.  It was pretty fun and rewarding getting to see the results of all of your hard work, immediately on the computer.  For the class we had to learn the basics of coding which I actually found enjoyable.  I was really interested in how computers even worked.  How could all of these images show up on the screen?  I wanted to know how the computer would know the answer to a math problem when you typed it in.  All of these technical things about computers always interested me.  I was fascinated by how they even worked.  I never learned the answers to these things, even though I could have just googled it.  But now that I have decided to major in Computer Science hopefully some of theses questions will be answered.  These have been my experiences with computers and it has definitely lead me to the point of where I am.</p>
		<p>Although I am from Maryland, I had already determined before deciding my major that I wanted to go to Michigan State.  There were many reasons for this.  My entire family is from Michigan except for my immediate family.  My Dad went to Michigan State and my sister is also a current student.  So no matter my major, I was going to Michigan State.  If I went with Accounting as my major, then the Broad Business College is one of the best in the country.  On the other hand if I went with Computer Science than the MSU Computer Science and Engineering School is also very prestigious.  I hope to learn many things while studying computer Science here at Michigan State.  I’m very fascinated in learning even more about coding.  Another thing I want to learn about is computer software.  How can you input code so that a computer can know what to do is something that would be great to learn.  I feel as if that my major in Computer Science gives me many opportunities in life.   Another plus is that I will actually enjoy the things that I study and learn about Computer Science, as opposed to the tedious work of crunching number being an accountant.</p>
		<p>Something that played a large role for me in picking Computer Science was the development of computers in our society.  A lot of people throughout the world interact with computers every single day.  My thought process was that if I major in Computer Science I would easily be able to get a good job.  From now through the future computers will always be used.  I’ve also heard numerous statistics that Computer Science is one of the top things to major in to get a job.   I’ve also heard that if you major in Computer Science, the starting salaries are pretty high.  But it wasn’t really about the money for me choosing to major in computer Science.  I just really enjoy messing around with computers.  My thinking is that if I’m going to be doing this for the rest of my life I better enjoy what I do.  And I can honestly say that I really enjoy Computer Science for what it is and not the money.</p>
		<p>All of my knowledge and interest in Computer Science is because of me going on computers when I was younger.   My mom would always yell at me for being on the computer too much.  But now I can say that those times when I was on the computer lead to where I am now.  Spending hours playing games was what I enjoyed doing as a kid and now as I grow up I will be able to mess around with computers again.   I really feel that computers and technology are the future of where the world is going.  My interest in computers and technology is also why I decided to take this Science and Technology writing course instead of the other writing course options. Another course that I am currently taking at Michigan State that I am very happy about is Computer Science and Engineering 101.  In the class we learn about core concepts in computing including information storage, retrieval, management, and representation. We also apply core concepts to design and to implement solutions to various focal problems, the usage of hardware, multimedia software, communication and networks. This course will help prepare me for more advanced Computer Science courses at Michigan State, and for the rest of my life.  This is just the beginning and hopefully there is better to come. All in all I am very pleased with my decision to major in Computer Science and I hope that I have a successful career and an enjoyable life.</p>
