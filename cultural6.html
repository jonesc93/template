			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>This balance allows for responsible people to acquire guns and for firearms to be kept out of criminal’s hands. There are already bans on types of ammunition and larger assault weapons, which is acceptable. I don’t think that anything beyond this can be done as far as gun control.  If my proposed precautions aren’t enacted than people everywhere could be in harms way.  But if more gun control laws than I suggest were imposed than that would be restricting on people’s rights and it would take the guns out of the hands of people that follow the law.  The affects in the long run should be slightly better.  Gun violence levels should decrease over a period of time.  However there will always be some violence.  That is inevitable.  With my solutions however we should be much better off as far as gun related violence in the United States.</p>
