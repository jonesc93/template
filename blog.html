			<h1>Blog Number 2</h1>
			<p> Earlier today we had the first class period of WRA 110: Science and Technology.  This is my first writing class at MSU and I am very excited for what is ahead this semester.  Overall, on this first day we were just getting introduced to what we would be doing in the course.  We went over the syllabus and the grading process for the class.  It seems that we only have to do 5 projects, which should be manageable.  I just wonder how long the papers will be because I hadn’t done that many large papers in High school.  We’ll see.</p>
<p>We did several things in class today to get ready for the rest of the semester.  First we set up our Github accounts.  This was a very confusing process at first.  I didn’t understand the whole repositories and gh pages and links thing.  I have no idea if I’ll be able to understand these concepts so I can actually upload my projects online.  We also were told that we would have to learn coding.  I suppose that this is so that we will know how to make our websites.  I know some basic html coding but I don’t know any Css so I’m looking forward to learning those things.  Lastly we went over how to make our blog and that we have to have 15 by the end of the semester.  I figured I would get off to a good start in case I end up not doing these blogs often.

			<p> Earlier this week we were introduced to our first project being the Lived Experiences project.  At first when I received the assignment I was a bit confused because it seemed like the assignment sheet was more complicated than it needed to be.  The sheet should just spell out what we need to do in a simple manner.  This is not what this sheet did. It used large words and confusing phrases for no purpose. </p>
<p>The lived experiences project as I understand it is that we need to write a paper on our past experience as it relates to a piece of technology.  At first it was hard to pick a subject because I had never thought about a piece of technology leading me to where I am today.  I thought about it some more and just decided to write on the computer.  I had been using computers my whole life and I thought that there was a lot I could write about as far as the computer goes.  The other issue that I came across had to relate it to the major that I had picked.  There wasn’t much affecting my choice to major in accounting as far as technology goes.  So since I had thought about majoring in computer science, I decided to write my paper with the piece of technology to computer science.</p>
<p>Overall it worked out well because I was able to fulfill the word requirement on the paper and it wasn’t too hard to write. I think my paper is well written ad hopefully I get a good grade on it.

			<h1>Blog Number 4 (In Class Activity 2)</h1>
			<p> In class we just watched an episode of South Park. I am actually a huge fan of South Park and think it is one of the most clever shows on television. They always find something in society to make fun of and point out how ridiculous things are.  This episode, “Make Love, Not Warcraft”, is one of my favorite episodes that they have ever made.<p>
<p>The group of people that is targeted to is people that spend a lot of time on the computer.  The social issue at hand is that many people spend hours playing computer games or just going on the computer wasting time.  They could be outside doing something but instead they play useless games.  I think that the creator’s critique of this social issue is acceptable.  They think that people should not waste so much of their life playing games on computers. Sure they exaggerate the time the kids spent on computers to make the show funny but overall the critique was good. I think that anyone that watches this episode can relate because it mainly is just pointing out that people spend too much time on computers.</p>
<p>Relating this to the cultural analysis project isn’t difficult. Basically in the paper I just have to pick a social issue and then have a cultural object that relates to it.  I want to pick something to write the paper on a topic that interests me.  South Park would have been a great idea but now I just need to find something different and original.
</p>
			
			<h1>Blog Number 5</h1>
			<p> Earlier this week the class was introduced to the Cultural Analysis project.  This project has us pick a piece of cultural media that addresses a social issue.  First we have to explain the piece of media we’ve chosen and explain it.  Then we have to find and explain the social issue and how it relates to the cultural media.  Lastly we have to then explain and give further detail into the social issue and ways to solve the issue. </p>
<p>I’ve had a hard time trying to find an idea to do my project on thus far.  South Park was a great example last week in class.  I also wanted to pick something that interested me so that I would have an easier time writing the paper and I could write more on it.  After a lot of searching for ideas, I came up with doing my paper on the song “No Guns Allowed” by Snoop Dogg.  The song addresses the issue of Gun Control in the United States. I thought this was a great idea for several reasons.</p>
<p>For me this was a great idea for a project for several reasons.  The first reason is that gun control is a really current issue.  There is a lot of information for me to write about.  The second reason this was a good idea was that I really enjoy hip-hop.  These two things gave me a lot to write.  Most importantly I was able to stay interested in the subject so it wasn’t that bad to write in the end.

			<h1>Blog Number 6 (In Class Activity 3)</h1>
			<p>In class we just watched an advertisement made by Chrysler for their car, the Chrysler 200.  The advertisement uses several techniques to get across a message to the viewers.  The use of Eminem and his song “Lose Yourself”, the imagery of Detroit, and the tagline imported from Detroit, are all effective marketing techniques.
</p><p>In the commercial the use of Eminem and his song are effective marketing strategies.  Many companies use celebrities to endorse products because they are popular figures and if they use a certain product, than people think that it is a quality product.  Since Eminem is a popular figure and he is from Detroit it is a good endorsement for Chrysler.  Since he is also rich it shows that the car can be a luxury car.  The song also sounds really tough so that would show the car is built well.  The imagery of Detroit in this commercial shows that the town is rough but can also be sophisticated.  These images make it seem that the car is built well and durable, but also a classy, luxury car.  Lastly, the tagline “Imported from Detroit” makes the car seem like it is made in Detroit.  Many, people like it when products are made in America because it stimulates the economy.  The tagline also reinforces the point that since it is imported from Detroit, the car will be durable, yet it is also a luxury vehicle.</p>
<p>In my mind I think that these techniques are effective and they worked well.  The point gets across to the viewer effectively. The message is clear and not confusing.  Overall I think it is a very good advertisement that achieved its goal of trying to sell more cars.

			<p>Two weeks ago we were assigned our third project for WRA 110, the Research project.  For me this was the toughest project that we have done so far.  The project consisted of us having to research the communication, research, and technology used in an academic field at MSU.  For my research project I chose the major of Criminal Justice at Michigan State.  Although it isn’t my major, last semester I took Intro to Criminal Justice and I am very interested in the field.  The worst part of the project is all of the research that you have to do.  Doing research and finding a lot of good information is crucial to having enough material to write about.  Another aspect that is very important is getting interviews with people in that field.  I contacted the professor and a friend that I knew very early on and that gave them and me enough time to get an interview done.  Another thing to consider is not writing your entire project at the last minute.  Unfortunately, this is exactly what I did.  If had not already done my research and gotten interviews done than I probably would not have been able to finish the paper on time.  This paper was a 3000 word paper and I was extremely lucky that I was able to finish the project in time. I wrote it all on the last day but I did nothing else that day.  It was very stressful and my life would have been made a lot easier if I had done the project in small increments. Overall, it was the most difficult project of the semester so far.</p>
			<h1>Blog Number 8</h1>
			<p>In class we just watched a documentary by the History Chanel on Ancient Aliens. It was a really interesting documentary in several ways.  One thing that was interesting or rather odd about the documentary was that none of it was based off of actual facts.  The documentary had several "experts" talk about how there could have been aliens in the past.  However there was no fact or proof behind a lot of statements that the “experts” made.  The documentary used several techniques to try and convey information.  They would have a narrator talk about how aliens could exist and then they would cut to a interview of a person telling a story and further explaining what the narrator said.</p><p>
Watching this documentary was helpful for me to try and figure out what I want to do for when we make a documentary. It helped me realize that when we make our documentary we should have experts and others give confessionals to the camera.  When you have an actual face that is telling you information it can further explain and be another source bedsides just a narrator.  Another thing that we can do is provide some substantial evidence or facts that what we are saying in the documentary is indeed true.  If we just say things without providing sources then less people would believe what we are saying. These are just a couple of ideas that could help my group make a good documentary that is informative and also entertaining to the audience.

			<p>Today we got our groups for our 4th major assignment in WRA 100, the Multimedia Remix project.  Along with getting our group assignments, we began to work on the project in class. First we wanted to come up with an interesting subject that the documentary would be on.  It was difficult coming up with a subject because nobody really wanted to step up and say, "Alright lets do it on such and such."  Another issue with picking a subject is that we wanted to make sure there was enough information to make a documentary on the subject.  Eventually we got an idea from one of the members, Nate, that we should do our project on racial profiling in airports.  Once we came up with a general idea of what we wanted to do the documentary on, we had to start working on the worksheet that was due the next Monday.  We divided up the tasks for who worked on each part of the worksheet and this seemed to work well.  Dividing the work like seemed to help so that not one person had to do much more than another person. We then began to work on the worksheet in class a bit. I think that it is important to make use of the time that the group has together so that you don't have to meet if you don't absolutely need too. This is because everyone is on different schedules and it can be difficult to meet sometimes.  The day was productive and we had a good plan of what we wanted to do with our project.</p>

			<p>Today I started to work on the Codecademy assignment for the class.  The purpose of the website is to teach people how to code.  Codecademy is a website that has little lessons that people can solve as they improve in their coding knowledge.  We were supposed to have been doing Codecademy from the beginning of the semester but I haven’t exactly been doing that. I had learned a little bit of coding in high school so I thought that I could manage and complete the Codecademy lessons later on.  I started doing the lessons and they can actually be a fun and they are very informative.  I have already used my newfound knowledge to improve on my portfolio.  So far I am about 50 percent through Codecademy.  I have actually enjoyed the experience and sometimes when I am bored will be working on Codecademy.  Through out working on Codecademy I have learned several things that are helpful to know.</p>

<p>I found that if you just sit down and do it that you could get a lot done.  You have to be focused and remember past lessons because it builds on its self.  So if you aren’t paying attention for one lesson and you just bullshit it than you won’t remember anything and you will be lost further on.  Overall I have really enjoyed Codecademy so far and I am glad that I am learning how to code because I think it will be important for this class, and also my future.

			<h1>Blog Number 13</h1>
			<p>This blog is going to be about how I have been writing my blogs for this course: WRA 110: Science and Technology.  At the beginning of the semester the teacher has stated that we should be working on our blogs and writing them throughout the semester.  One reason that she instructed us to do this was because we would be doing a final course retrospective at the end and it would be us reflecting on the semester.  The blogs could help us look back at the semester.  The other reason was that if we did them throughout the semester than we wouldn’t have to rush and write them all at the end of the semester.</p><p>

Unfortunately, I have gone against the second point mentioned and I have waited until the end of the semester to write several of my blog entries.  It has been a difficult process because I am writing many of these entries while having to try and remember what we did at the time of some of these projects.  Keeping up with the blogs is worth id solely for the purposes of writing the Final Course Retrospective paper.  I had a tough time because I couldn’t remember some details but if I had them in the blog then I would know.  </p><p>
Overall, the blogs still have some good detail and I was able to write a quality final project but it would have been much easier on myself if I had written these blogs throughout the semester.

			<p> Today April 21, 2014, was the last class that we meet of the semester in WRA 110.  In class today we mostly were going to be continuing work for earlier in the course.  First the teacher went over several expectations for the end of the semester and what we needed to do for several projects and how to get the best grades.  This was helpful because I learned several things that I needed to know.  For example, for the blog you have to have 15 written and it needs to be 250 words.  This knowledge was essential to know because many of my blogs were under the 250 word limit.  As of right now, literally minutes ago, I’ve had to go back and change many of my blogs.  Another thing that we talked about was that you have to change your portfolio so that it doesn’t look the same as when we set it up.  This was good to know because my portfolio had looked the same as normal. I then went and changed my portfolio by changing the colors, adding a background image, changing font hover colors, changing the font color and size, and several other things.  </p>
<p>Lastly in class we met with our groups for the final project website to figure out all the final details.  We had all written a description and some advice for incoming freshmen and all we had to do was send it in to the Website team.  Overall the class period was eventful and it was a good lass class period.

			<h1>Blog Number 15</h1>
			<p>Today is April 28, 2014, the day of our final in WRA 110 at Michigan State.  This is the last day of my first year writing course at MSU.  We don’t actually have a final exam for this class and I am very happy about that.  I don’t even know what an exam would have been on so I suppose that is why there is none. </p>
<p>Even though we don’t have an exam today, there are several other things that we have to accomplish and turn in today.  One of those things is we have to finish our final paper and turn it in on Dropbox and submit it to our portfolio.  Speaking of our portfolio, we have to submit the link for it and have it working properly.  We also have to have all 15 blogs written and then our link to our blogs submitted online.  The purpose of me writing this blog is to explain all of the things that we must do for the final day of WRA 110 at Michigan State.  The last and final reason that I am writing this blog is that we are required to have 15 Blogs.  Currently I have 14 blogs submitted.  Therefore I am writing this blog because I waited to the last minute needed one more blog.   At this point I am done writing this blog but I realized I needed about 20 more words for this particular entry.  I don’t recommend waiting to the last minute for your blogs.
