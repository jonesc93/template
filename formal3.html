			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>What many people may not know is that the practice of Criminal Justice has not always been around.  In ancient societies, there was no law enforcement what so ever.  There was no organization of a force that could protect the community.  This means that criminal justice was not studied in ancient times.  As cultures and societies developed, law enforcement became a role performed by militaries.  For example in the Roman Empire, the military played an extremely important role in maintaining civil order. The first modern police force was created in the city of Paris, France by King Louis XIV in 1667. This police force was a lot different than today.  They dealt exclusively in maintaining order and arresting criminals. In the United States, the first organized police services were established in Boston in 1838, New York in 1844, and Philadelphia in 1854.  In the Early 1900’s, is when University’s first started to offer Criminal Justice programs.  With the change in technology and the sociology of humans, Criminal Justice programs have developed immensely over the years.   Criminal justice programs aim to teach many things to the students in the discipline.  The Michigan State University School of Criminal Justice explains what students will learn in their program: “Understanding patterns and causes of crime, the challenges facing criminal justice agencies as they seek to balance crime control with preservation of civil liberties, and the growing importance of security management in what has been called the “risk society” are just some of the issues you will study as a criminal justice major.”   After graduating with a Criminal Justice degree, students have an opportunity to acquire several different jobs.  Some of these job opportunities include Patrol Officer, Police Sheriff's Deputy, State Trooper, Paralegal or Legal Assistant, Probation community control, correctional Treatment Specialist, Detective or Criminal Investigator, and a Legal Secretary.  The academic discipline if Criminal Justice is extremely important in out society.  Criminal Justice is so important because the people that study in the discipline will go on to be people that are protecting the community that they serve.  If these people are going to be protecting communities across the country it is imperative that they are learning by using research, technology, and communication in the field and in the classroom.</p>
