			<h2>Blog Number 2</h2>
			<p>In class we just watched an episode of South Park. I am actually a huge fan of South Park and think it is one of the most clever shows on television. They always find something in society to make fun of and point out how ridiculous things are.  This episode, “Make Love, Not Warcraft”, is one of my favorite episodes that they have ever made.  
	The group of people that is targeted to is people that spend a lot of time on the computer.  The social issue at hand is that many people spend hours playing computer games or just going on the computer wasting time.  They could be outside doing something but instead they play useless games.  I think that the creator’s critique of this social issue is acceptable.  They think that people should not waste so much of their life playing games on computers. Sure they exaggerate the time the kids spent on computers to make the show funny but overall the critique was good. I think that anyone that watches this episode can relate because it mainly is just pointing out that people spend too much time on computers.
