			<h1>Blog Number 2 (In Class Activity 2)</h1>
			<p>In class we just watched an episode of South Park. I am actually a huge fan of South Park and think it is one of the most clever shows on television. They always find something in society to make fun of and point out how ridiculous things are.  This episode, “Make Love, Not Warcraft”, is one of my favorite episodes that they have ever made.</p>
	<p>The group of people that is targeted to is people that spend a lot of time on the computer.  The social issue at hand is that many people spend hours playing computer games or just going on the computer wasting time.  They could be outside doing something but instead they play useless games.  I think that the creator’s critique of this social issue is acceptable.  They think that people should not waste so much of their life playing games on computers. Sure they exaggerate the time the kids spent on computers to make the show funny but overall the critique was good. I think that anyone that watches this episode can relate because it mainly is just pointing out that people spend too much time on computers.

			<p>In class we just watched an advertisement made by Chrysler for their car, the Chrysler 200.  The advertisement uses several techniques to get across a message to the viewers.  The use of Eminem and his song “Lose Yourself”, the imagery of Detroit, and the tagline imported from Detroit, are all effective marketing techniques.</p>
<p>In the commercial the use of Eminem and his song are effective marketing strategies.  Eminem is a popular figure and he is from Detroit.  Since he is also rich it shows that the car can be a luxury car.  The song also sounds really tough so that would show the car is built well.  The imagery of Detroit in this commercial shows that the town is rough but can also be sophisticated.  These images make it seem that the car is built well and durable, but also a classy, luxury car.  Lastly, the tagline imported from Detroit, makes it seem like the car is made in Detroit.  Many, people like it when products are mad in America because it stimulates the economy.  The tagline also reinforces the point that since it is imported from Detroit, the car will be durable, yet it is also a luxury vehicle.</p>
<p>In my mind I think that these techniques are effective.  The point gets across well. The message is clear and not confusing.  Overall I think it is a very good advertisement.
