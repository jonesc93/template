			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Gun control is defined by the Merriam Webster dictionary as, “laws that control how guns are sold and used and who can buy them.”  Gun control has a long history in the United States of America and it began at the same time that this country was formed.  In 1791 the Constitution was ratified and with that the Second Amendment stated,  “A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.”  This Amendment gave all people the right to bear arms.  After this amendment there weren’t really any major laws concerning gun control until 1968.  At that time the Gun Control Act of 1968 was passed into law.  This law was enacted for the purpose of keeping guns out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them because of age, criminal background, or incompetence.  Before this law there hadn’t been mush restriction on owning guns at all.  However, after this law and up until 1999, there have been many gun control laws that have been passed.  These laws include: the forming of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, registration of all firearms, penalties for people that have guns that aren’t qualified, bans on types of ammunition, bans on importing or manufacturing semi-auto and assault rifles, as well as criminal background checks.  Ever since technology has advanced and there have been more gun control laws, the opposition to gun control has also grown.  Most of the people that are opposed to gun control laws are conservative republicans.  The reason that most people use to oppose gun control, is that it goes against a literal interpretation of the Second Amendment.  The side that tends to be for gun control laws is the liberal democrats.  A person’s opinion on this matter doesn’t have to match party lines all the time however.  Many people feel that there should be gun control laws imply because they don’t like all of the violence that guns could cause.  To come up with a solution of how to solve gun control, one would have to analyze both sides of the argument on whether the United States of America should have gun control laws.  
There are an extraordinary amount of arguments for and against gun control laws.  The main arguments for gun control as follows.  First of all, the main theory for gun control laws is that most violent crimes are committed with guns; therefore, limiting the amount of people that own guns will likely reduce the number of gun related violence crimes.  Another reason for gun control is that mentally unstable, bullied kids, or disgruntled workers, and others can cause mass casualties with guns that wouldn't be possible if guns weren’t as accessible.  Some of the biggest reasons that gun control is being so heavily discussed in politics nowadays is because of school and mass shootings.  With legalized gun ownership, guns have a greater chance of falling into the hands of kids, which could result in these mass shootings and accidents.  Mass shootings also seem to be a “trend” now that it is occurring more often. This makes guns even more dangerous.  Lastly, the response to the constitution that the side of pro gun control takes is that the constitution was targeted toward the militia, the modern day National Guard, and not individuals.  These reasons along with many more are why people, along with Snoop Dogg, believe there should be more gun control laws in the United States.
The side against gun control also has many valid reasons of why there should be less restriction on guns.  The main theory for the argument against gun control is that criminals will always find a way to acquire a gun.  Creating more gun control laws will just take guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens that they could use for self-defense.  Another plausible theory is that crimes are often prevented by the possibility that a victim has a gun.  If gun control laws were passed than criminals would feel safer to commit crimes and get away with it.  Many people especially women also like to carry guns for self-protection.  If guns are taken away then that protection is gone.  Some of the other reasons that more conservative republicans think gun control is wrong is because taking away there guns is one less liberty they have and one step closer to socialism.  They also think that guns could be a protection against government tyranny.  All of these aside the main reason and argument against gun control is that the Second Amendment to the Constitution protects the individuals right to owning a gun.</p>
