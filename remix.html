            <h2>Carson Jones - Personal Memo</h2>
        <p>For the Multimedia Remix Project our group chose to make a documentary on the issue of Racial Profiling in Airports.  Our group came up with our idea by Nate suggesting that we make a documentary on something similar to his Cultural Analysis Paper.  We mainly picked his because nobody else suggested anything and he stepped up with an idea.  The group liked the idea so we stuck with it.  The topic of Racial profiling in airports had a lot of information for it as well.  This is also made things difficult.  The most challenging part of the project for me was figuring out the timeline or storyboard for the documentary.  Since I edited the entire video, I had a lot of facts, video clips, and pictures to use, and it was difficult figuring out which order they should go in to tell a good story.  Figuring out where each fact or interview should go in the documentary was a stressful process.  To help I tried to take a systematic approach.  I wrote out a script to help me with where I would say information in the video.  I also wrote out what pictures or video I would be showing while I was talking.  Taking a systematic approach and coming up with a “storyboard” for the documentary was a long process but it definitely helped me stay organized.</p><p>

Research was definitely played a large role in the formation of the documentary.  The most beneficial resource was the Internet.   I obtained pictures and video clips to use in the background of the video from online resources.  Websites online that were especially helpful was articles from a professor at Santa Clara University and from CivilRights.Org.  
</p><p>
Interaction with other group members was crucial for the project.  Nate, Ali, and myself did all of the work for this project.  Jiandan Hu did absolutely nothing for the project.  On the day the project was introduced she was present in class and she created a Google docs for us to use.  This was all that she contributed to the project.  Any of us could have created this Google doc in class and she happened to be the one that did.  Ali and Nate both conducted interviews and found some videos for me to use in the video.  They also suggested some websites I use for information.  I then took all the information and created the video.  I edited the video as well as found facts, pictures, and clips to use in the video.  For the three of us that participated, working in a group was definitely fruitful.  Spreading the work around made tasks easier to accomplish since there was a more manageable amount of work for each person.
</p><p>
Overall the project was planned out well.  To increase efficiency we came up with deadlines for each of us to accomplish tasks by. We finished the documentary well ahead of the due date and that made things less stressful for everyone involved.  If I were to do this project over again I might not have taken as much of the workload.  I believe that the editing of the video took the most time and effort of all the other tasks.  Besides this I don’t think I would have done anything differently because I think the video turned out well.  
</p><p>
	The documentary that our group made was effective in design.  I think the most effective part of the video was when a fact would be stated in a voiceover and then an interview would be shown to give further detail.  While making this video I learned more about racial profiling in airports.  The finished product should also be informative for the audience.</p>
