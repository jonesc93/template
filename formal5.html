			<h1>Technology Section</h1>
			<p>Technology is an even more effective tool for helping students to learn.  Technology also happens to be a main reason for a decrease in crime rates across America.  Technology is used in the discipline of Criminal justice to teach students in the classroom and it is also used by police officers that practice in the field of study.  There are several ways that technology is used in the classrooms of Criminal justice programs.  First, the internet and computers have revolutionized how students learn and consume information.  In a study done by the Pew Research Center they found that 98% of Undergrads and 99% of Graduate students use the Internet.  In the past these numbers would have been much lower.

With the newfound wave of computers and the Internet, teaching and learning are much easier than ever before.  In the classroom teachers use PowerPoint’s as a visual aide to their lectures.  This makes it easier for students that are more visual learners.  Teachers also put their PowerPoint’s online for students to study with and learn from.  Many teachers can give students extra information with websites such as Desire 2 Learn.  They can communicate much easier with students as with.  A lot of the technology assists in making communication easier, which I will discuss later.  As far as police officers in the field, there is a lot of technology that is used by people that practice the discipline.  Just like students technology makes things much easier for people that practice in the field of Criminal Justice.  As previously stated technology has greatly increased in the past 20 years or so.  In this graph from Brian A. Reaves of the Bureau of Justice Statistics, one can see that in every police department the use of computers in the field has increased.

With the increase of use of technology, not just computers, crime rates have decreased over the last 20 years as well. This graph from the FBI shows that violent crime rates have decreased over the last several years.

It is no coincidence that with a rise in technology there has been a decline in crime rates.  This shows that technology is a very important part of people who practice the academic discipline of Criminal justice.  Criminologist, James Alan Fox, also concurs with the idea that we are safer now because of technology.  He says we are safer because of “Improved law enforcement strategies, including advances in computer analysis and innovative technology.”  There are several new innovative technologies that people who practice the discipline of Criminal justice use.  These technologies are broken into two different categories.  One of them is called, hard technology and the other is soft technology.  Hard technology includes hardware or materials that can be used to control and prevent crime.  Some examples of hard technology that play large roles in policing include improved weapons, computers in squad cars, and GPS systems.  Soft technology includes computer software or information systems that involve the strategic use of information to prevent crime and to improve the performance of the police.  Some examples of soft technology are threat assessment instruments, crime mapping (hot spots for crime), shared databases of information, and new methods to monitor communications.  Crime mapping and shared databases are perhaps the most effective of these new technologies.  People that practice in the discipline of Criminal justice use all of these forms of technology.  It shows that technology is a very useful tool in the academic discipline of Criminal Justice.
