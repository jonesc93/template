			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>On April 2, 2013, Snoop Dogg released the single, “No Guns Allowed”.  According to Snoop Dogg he created this song due to the recent events at Sandy Hook Elementary. This song mainly touches on Snoop Dogg’s theory that there should be “no guns allowed”.  He is saying more than that however. In breaking down the song we have the first verse, and it goes, “Money makes a man and that’s a crime, If we all were rich, we’d spend more time, with our daughters and sons they’re losing their minds, We all feel hurt, here’s mine, hear me now.”  The message of these first couple of lines is that he doesn’t want his kids, as he is a dad of 3, growing up with violence in the world.  Snoop is pointing out the fact that being poor is often a reason that some people turn to violence. The line, “We all feel hurt,” sticks out to me because I think he is trying to say that violence hurts all of us as a nation and it distresses every single person.  The last line of this verse is Snoop Dogg asking for us to listen to his stance on gun control.  The next verse is the chorus and the main message of the song.  It goes, “Cause, no guns are allowed in here tonight, Were gonna have a free for all, no fights, I wanna get lost in the crowd in here tonight, I need to hear my thoughts turn the music up loud.”  The first line is the main point of this song.  When Snoop Dogg sings the line “Cause, no guns are allowed in here tonight,” he is expressing his opinion for gun control in the United States. “Were gonna have a free for all, no fights,” means that he wants everyone to be together and unified, without fighting and violence.  The next verse goes, “Let the music play, me don’t want to hear no more gunplay, When the bodies hit the ground, there’s nothing left to say, ay, ay, Me don’t want to see no more innocent bloodshed, Me don’t want to see more youth dead, Come hear me now.”  In the first line Snoop expresses how he doesn’t want people to play around with guns anymore.  He goes on to say that he doesn’t want any innocent blood to be shed.  He states this because in mass shootings the people affected are most of the time innocent people.   Lastly when he cries, “Me don’t want to see more youth dead,” it is a reaction to the deaths that occurred as a result of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. In this song Snoop Dogg is essentially saying that he believes there should be more gun control laws in the United States because of the fact that innocent people and children are dying from gun violence.</p>
