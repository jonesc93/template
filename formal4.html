			<h1>Communication Section</h1>
			<p>Lastly, and probably the most important tool that people use in the discipline of Criminal justice, is communication.  It is very important that students communicate in the classroom.  Students must communicate with there teachers to make sure that they know everything that is going on in the class.  If a student does not understand something than by communicating with the teacher you can get a better grasp on what you need to comprehend.  Communicating with other students is also something that people who are studying Criminal justice can do.  They can ask each other questions to better understand the class material.  They can also communicate and study together.  Forming study groups is quite an effective way for people to do well and get a good grade.  </p>
	<p>Outside the classroom and in the field, good communication skills are probably the most important thing that a police officer can have.  With the emergence of community-oriented policing, a lot of police work now involves helping people solve problems to keep them out of the criminal justice system, rather than putting people into the system. Police officers often encounter people when they're at their worst. Gang members, drug addicts, and people who drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs are only a few examples of the people you'll meet as a police officer.  In order to deal with these kinds of people communication skills are extremely important.  I wanted to confirm whether or not a former police officer agreed that communication was as important as it seems.  I conducted an interview with Carl Barber, a former police officer, who currently works as a security guard at the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum at Michigan State University.  I asked him about the importance of communication and he responded, “Having good communication skills and understanding how to communicate well and interact with not only citizens, but criminals, is extremely important.” He went on to explain, “It (communication) can keep you out of trouble, it can keep you out of unnecessary fights, and just possibly in extreme cases, it can keep you alive.” </p>
	<p>Communication is undoubtedly extremely important. But what and how are some of the ways that police officers communicate?  Police officers have many duties that have to do with communication.  Officers often have to respond to radio calls and communicate over the radio with other officers.  Another way that officers communicate is with other agencies.  The use of shared databases has greatly increased efficiency when it comes to sharing information.  Before these databases many agencies did not share information with each other and it was much less efficient.  Police officers also must appear in court.  It is essential that they have good communication skills in court to help with the progress of cases.  Writing is also a large part of a police officers job.  They must write reports of cases that they are working.  This means that police officers must have adequate writing skills.  Writing skills also applies to students who are studying in the discipline of Criminal justice.  Often students will have write papers for a large percentage of their grade.  That is why writing is imperative for students and police officers.  Lastly and most importantly police officers have to deal with the public.  Carl Barber explained, “Good communication skills can diffuse violent situations before a person gets angry. It can get people to do what you want them to, and can help to generate a constructive relationship with the public.”  Your mouth and communication skills are the most important tools when it comes to dealing with citizens of the public.  Just by showing a little understanding and sympathy, people will be left with an encouraging impression of law enforcement that can go a long way in community affairs.  Carl Barber described that, “When you show empathy while talking to victims, it can help get a lot more out of them in the future.”  </p>
	<p>Communications within the ranks of the police department are also crucial toward the department running smoothly.  Communication is the primary vehicle for bringing about agreement between all the members of a department as to the police objectives. It is the base for a common and continuing understanding of problems and accomplishments experienced in the day-to-day pursuits toward the objectives.  There is a very specific way in which departments should communicate.  There should be clear channels for funneling information.  The first step is that someone initiates the communication.  Next someone transits the information from the source to the destination.  The steps are not over until the communication makes an impact on the recipient.  Overall communication is the most important part of a student in learning.  If a student does not receive the information well from the teacher than the student will not perform well.  Communication is key for students studying in the academic discipline of criminal justice as well as for police officers and departments that practice in the discipline of criminal justice.
