			<h1>Research Section</h1>
			<p>Research plays a large role in the academic discipline of Criminal Justice.  Most if not all University’s that have a Criminal Justice program use research to teach and inform students.  For example, the first line of Michigan State University’s School of Criminal Justice mission statement, reads, “The School of Criminal Justice is committed to academic excellence through research, education, and engagement.”  This shows that research is an important factor in the education of students that major in Criminal Justice. In an interview I conducted with Professor Holt, a Criminal justice teacher at Michigan State University, I asked about the different types of research that students conduct in the Criminal Justice program.  The response was that, “Students in upper levels will research for projects, whereas underclassmen will read textbooks and research mainly for studying purposes.”  My summary of all that was said is that upperclassmen and graduate level students will be assigned projects due to the lower class sizes.  This makes it easier for Professors to grade.  In the lower levels of the Criminal justice program the class sizes are large and can have several hundred people in them.  These classes mainly consist of lectures where the professor will teach the material.  Then there will only be a few tests that make up the majority of your grade.  The research done in these classes only has to deal with the studying that students will perform to do well on tests.  When people move into the field, there are also several means of research involved.  Police officers must read reports of crimes that have occurred.  In Criminal Justice programs these techniques are taught and learned.  Also in a way, any investigative work done by detectives or police officers could be considered research.  When a crime is committed detectives must observe the crime scene.  If any leads or clues are found then they investigate into those clues.  This step of investigating into any leads uses many research skill that are learned in Criminal Justice programs.  Any investigative work is a form of research because they are trying to distinguish new information about a subject.  Overall research is a tool utilized by Criminal justice programs to assist students in learning the most information possible, and to help prepare students for researching tasks outside of school.</p>
