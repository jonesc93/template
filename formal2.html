			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>One of the more popular majors in college campuses across the country is Criminal Justice.  Many people enjoy a challenge, and there are few career fields more challenging than law enforcement and criminal justice related work. Police work, performed well, has many challenges, both mental and physical.  Many pick the discipline of Criminal Justice as a major because it is interesting to study and it has exiting work after one graduates.  One of the exciting parts of criminal justice is that students will often go out into the field before they graduate.  This is often in an internship with a police station.  Many of the skills that students learn will help them in the classroom and in the field while they are studying.  In the process of getting a degree in Criminal Justice students will have to research, use technology, and also communicate well.  These attributes expand past studying to get a degree and into the real world of police work.   Research, technology, and communication are all vital resources that can be used while in school and after one graduates, in the academic discipline of Criminal Justice.</p>
