			<h1>Blog Number 2</h1>
			<p> Earlier today we had the first class period of WRA 110: Science and Technology.  This is my first writing class at MSU and I am very excited for what is ahead this semester.  Overall, on this first day we were just getting introduced to what we would be doing in the course.  We went over the syllabus and the grading process for the class.  It seems that we only have to do 5 projects, which should be manageable.  I just wonder how long the papers will be because I hadn’t done that many large papers in High school.  We’ll see.</p>
<p>We did several things in class today to get ready for the rest of the semester.  First we set up our Github accounts.  This was a very confusing process at first.  I didn’t understand the whole repositories and gh pages and links thing.  I have no idea if I’ll be able to understand these concepts so I can actually upload my projects online.  We also were told that we would have to learn coding.  I suppose that this is so that we will know how to make our websites.  I know some basic html coding but I don’t know any Css so I’m looking forward to learning those things.  Lastly we went over how to make our blog and that we have to have 15 by the end of the semester.  I figured I would get off to a good start in case I end up not doing these blogs often.

			<p> Earlier this week we were introduced to our first project being the Lived Experiences project.  At first when I received the assignment I was a bit confused because it seemed like the assignment sheet was more complicated than it needed to be.  The sheet should just spell out what we need to do in a simple manner.  This is not what this sheet did. It used large words and confusing phrases for no purpose. </p>
<p>The lived experiences project as I understand it is that we need to write a paper on our past experience as it relates to a piece of technology.  At first it was hard to pick a subject because I had never thought about a piece of technology leading me to where I am today.  I thought about it some more and just decided to write on the computer.  I had been using computers my whole life and I thought that there was a lot I could write about as far as the computer goes.  The other issue that I came across had to relate it to the major that I had picked.  There wasn’t much affecting my choice to major in accounting as far as technology goes.  So since I had thought about majoring in computer science, I decided to write my paper with the piece of technology to computer science.</p>
<p>Overall it worked out well because I was able to fulfill the word requirement on the paper and it wasn’t too hard to write. I think my paper is well written ad hopefully I get a good grade on it.

			<h1>Blog Number 4 (In Class Activity 2)</h1>
			<p> In class we just watched an episode of South Park. I am actually a huge fan of South Park and think it is one of the most clever shows on television. They always find something in society to make fun of and point out how ridiculous things are.  This episode, “Make Love, Not Warcraft”, is one of my favorite episodes that they have ever made.<p>
<p>The group of people that is targeted to is people that spend a lot of time on the computer.  The social issue at hand is that many people spend hours playing computer games or just going on the computer wasting time.  They could be outside doing something but instead they play useless games.  I think that the creator’s critique of this social issue is acceptable.  They think that people should not waste so much of their life playing games on computers. Sure they exaggerate the time the kids spent on computers to make the show funny but overall the critique was good. I think that anyone that watches this episode can relate because it mainly is just pointing out that people spend too much time on computers.</p>
<p>Relating this to the cultural analysis project isn’t difficult. Basically in the paper I just have to pick a social issue and then have a cultural object that relates to it.  I want to pick something to write the paper on a topic that interests me.  South Park would have been a great idea but now I just need to find something different and original.

			<p> Earlier this week the class was introduced to the Cultural Analysis project.  This project has us pick a piece of cultural media that addresses a social issue.  First we have to explain the piece of media we’ve chosen and explain it.  Then we have to find and explain the social issue and how it relates to the cultural media.  Lastly we have to then explain and give further detail into the social issue and ways to solve the issue. </p>
<p>I’ve had a hard time trying to find an idea to do my project on thus far.  South Park was a great example last week in class.  I also wanted to pick something that interested me so that I would have an easier time writing the paper and I could write more on it.  After a lot of searching for ideas, I came up with doing my paper on the song “No Guns Allowed” by Snoop Dogg.  The song addresses the issue of Gun Control in the United States. I thought this was a great idea for several reasons.</p>
<p>For me this was a great idea for a project for several reasons.  The first reason is that gun control is a really current issue.  There is a lot of information for me to write about.  The second reason this was a good idea was that I really enjoy hip-hop.  These two things gave me a lot to write.  Most importantly I was able to stay interested in the subject so it wasn’t that bad to write in the end.

			<h1>Blog Number 6 (In Class Activity 3)</h1>
			<p>In class we just watched an advertisement made by Chrysler for their car, the Chrysler 200.  The advertisement uses several techniques to get across a message to the viewers.  The use of Eminem and his song “Lose Yourself”, the imagery of Detroit, and the tagline imported from Detroit, are all effective marketing techniques.
</p><p>In the commercial the use of Eminem and his song are effective marketing strategies.  Many companies use celebrities to endorse products because they are popular figures and if they use a certain product, than people think that it is a quality product.  Since Eminem is a popular figure and he is from Detroit it is a good endorsement for Chrysler.  Since he is also rich it shows that the car can be a luxury car.  The song also sounds really tough so that would show the car is built well.  The imagery of Detroit in this commercial shows that the town is rough but can also be sophisticated.  These images make it seem that the car is built well and durable, but also a classy, luxury car.  Lastly, the tagline “Imported from Detroit” makes the car seem like it is made in Detroit.  Many, people like it when products are made in America because it stimulates the economy.  The tagline also reinforces the point that since it is imported from Detroit, the car will be durable, yet it is also a luxury vehicle.</p>
<p>In my mind I think that these techniques are effective and they worked well.  The point gets across to the viewer effectively. The message is clear and not confusing.  Overall I think it is a very good advertisement that achieved its goal of trying to sell more cars.

			<p>Today I started to work on the Codecademy assignment for the class.  The purpose of the website is to teach people how to code.  Codecademy is a website that has little lessons that people can solve as they improve in their coding knowledge.  We were supposed to have been doing Codecademy from the beginning of the semester but I haven’t exactly been doing that. I had learned a little bit of coding in high school so I thought that I could manage and complete the Codecademy lessons later on.  I started doing the lessons and they can actually be a fun and they are very informative.  I have already used my newfound knowledge to improve on my portfolio.  So far I am about 50 percent through Codecademy.  I have actually enjoyed the experience and sometimes when I am bored will be working on Codecademy.  Through out working on Codecademy I have learned several things that are helpful to know.</p>

<p>I found that if you just sit down and do it that you could get a lot done.  You have to be focused and remember past lessons because it builds on its self.  So if you aren’t paying attention for one lesson and you just bullshit it than you won’t remember anything and you will be lost further on.  Overall I have really enjoyed Codecademy so far and I am glad that I am learning how to code because I think it will be important for this class, and also my future.
