            <p>WRA 110 and first year writing at Michigan State University is a basic introduction to writing at a more advanced level than high school writing.  The purpose of first year writing is to increase students, reading, researching, and writing skills needed for success in the future.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the semester writing was one of my least favorite things to do.  In high school I always dreaded having to write a paper on a book that was boring to me.  One of the things that helped me this semester was the freedom to write papers on topics that I picked.  By writing papers on subjects that I was actually interested really helped me to be more interested in my projects.  I think that for students to succeed in writing they should pick subjects that interest them.  It keeps you much more involved and interested while having to write long papers.</p>
            <p>The first paper that we wrote was the Lived Experiences Paper.  This paper is the shortest of the papers during the semester.  It is a good introduction to the type of writing expected throughout the remainder of the semester.  It also helps that this paper is based of your own experiences.  This is good because it is a lot like telling a story.  Ever since people have been little children, they’ve listened to stories being told.  This is why it is fairly easy to write a paper like a story.  In this paper you write about how a piece of technology has lead you to choosing the major or field of study that you are entering at Michigan State.  In this paper it seemed like I rambled a lot and repeated a lot of ideas.  This isn’t the best way to write a paper because it can get boring and repetitive.  However, it did get the point across well.  I feel like for future students to succeed at this paper you should just tell a story of your life with a piece of technology and how it has gotten you to where you are today.</p>
            <p>The second paper that our class wrote was the Cultural Analysis Project.  This paper was about analyzing a cultural document such as a movie, video, or song that addressed a social issue and looking further into the social issue.  Once again, I think the most important part for writing a long paper such as this is to pick a topic that interests the writer.  I chose to write my paper about the issue of Gun Control in the United States, seen through the song, No Guns Allowed by Snoop Dogg.  I chose to do this because I am interested in rap music and this made it more interesting to write.  Another tip for future students would be to do some research on the issue that you pick.  If you provide past examples of times where your issue was significant, than that can be good information to write about.  For my paper I wrote about past incidences of gun violence in America.  I also did research on gun control laws so that I could be well informed while writing the paper.  Overall, the most important part is to have an opinion on the subject that you choose.  This is extremely important because you have to write about how to solve the issue and what should be done about it.  If you have a strong opinion on the matter than you will have a lot to write about.</p>
            <p>The next project of first year writing and WRA 110 at Michigan State was the Formal Research Project.  This project was about researching a major or field of study at Michigan State and researching the ways that communication, technology, and research is used in these fields.  My paper was about the major of Criminal Justice at Michigan State.  I chose this because, once again, I am interested in the subject.  There is a lot of information out there for this research project; students just have to be willing to do the work to find it. Future students should definitely do a lot of research for this project.  That way you have a lot of information to write on.  Students should use all of the research resource at their disposal.  This means not just using the Internet.  Students should go to the library and look through books on the major that their paper is on. This project was by far the most difficult paper that I had to write during this semester.  One thing that made it extremely difficult was how long the paper had to be.  Coming up with 3,000 words to write on can be difficult and may seem repetitive, but that is why researching and gathering a lot of information is crucial.  If you have enough research than the paper will be well written and not repetitive.  I believe I was able to do this in my paper.  Another thing that made this paper difficult was the fact that I waited until the last minute to write it.  For any future students, I highly recommend that you do not wait until the last day to write an entire 3,000-word paper.  I am saying this from experience.  I was luck that I had gathered a lot of research ahead of time.  If I had not done this then I would not have finished the paper in time.  Overall, I believe that even though I waited until the last minute, the knowledge I had gained thus far in the course allowed me to finish the paper and have a decent final product. </p>
            <p>The last project before the final in WRA 110 was the Multimedia Remix Project.  In this project a group had to make a short documentary about a project that they had previously written about.  My group chose to do our project on the current state of racial profiling.  This was is what one of our group members’ Cultural Analysis project was on and it was the easiest project to do a documentary on.  This was a good topic to choose because there was a lot of information available.  Our documentary ended up being really well done because the communication between the group was great.  The group working well together is crucial for the success of the project.  If everyone does their part no one person should have to do more than another.  I would say to future students that you should choose a topic with a lot of information so that you have enough to work with.  Another thing that is important is having interviews for the documentary.  They provide separate opinions, knowledge, and a different point of view for your documentary.  It is important to have a good interview to put in to the documentary.  Just like the other projects, you shouldn’t wait until the last minute to edit and put the video together.  People’s schedules may not match up so it’s important to meet when you can and finish the video early.  Overall the documentary can be a fun thing to film and put together but there has to be good communication between the group.</p>
            <p>There are several other aspects to the class besides the major projects that student have to attain to.  People in the class should always show up to class because many times we will do activities that are graded that you would only know how to do if you were present in class.  It is also very important that students keep up with and write their blogs.  For the purposes of writing this final project you have to look back at all of your blogs and see what you have been doing in the course.  If you don’t do your blogs than it can be difficult to remember what you have done so far in the course.  Students also want to make sure to pace themselves when it comes to Codecademy.  You don’t want to get behind on blogs or Codecademy because then you will be extremely busy at the end of the year. </p>
            <p>Overall, there are several major tips that can be valuable for future students to hear.  One is that they should never wait until the last minute to write an entire paper.  This leads to rushed and sloppy work that isn’t of very good quality.  They should also communicate with people in their groups as well as the teacher.  If they have any questions on the projects they need to ask to clarify and make sure they know what it going on.  Lastly, students should always write about subjects that they are interested in.  It makes your papers better because you are actually interested and involved in the writing.  These are some of the things that I would have liked to have been told going into first year writing at MSU.</p>
