			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>In this paper I will use the song “No Guns Allowed” by Snoop Lion, better known as Snoop Dogg, to bring up the issue of gun control in our society.  Principally, the song “No Guns Allowed,” is about how Snoop Dogg believes that there should be more gun control laws in the United States.  This song is coming shortly after the events of several mass shooting throughout the past several years.  Gun control laws have a storied history throughout the United States’ past.  It is a highly debated subject in current political talks.  There are many arguments for and against gun control.  I will discuss these and then present my solution to the issue.  My solution has to do with having the best balance, so that safety is ensured and that people’s rights are not infringed on.  Overall, gun control is, and will be a highly controversial issue until the right balance of laws, and the freedom to own a firearm, is reached.</p>
