			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>One of the most discussed social issues in politics, and in today’s society, is the issue of gun control.  It seems that just about everyone in the United States has an opinion on the matter.  This includes many famous people as well.  With the music industry being one of the largest platforms to have one’s message heard, rapper Snoop Lion, or better known as Snoop Dogg, released a song addressing the issue of gun control.  The song, released on April 2, 2013, is called “No Guns Allowed”.  The song was released shortly after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. The school shooting, rightfully so, struck a chord in many peoples minds.  It made people have an opinion about the current state of gun control in the United States.  One of the people who the shooting affected was Snoop Dogg. In an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, Snoop Dogg explicates, "Once I've seen, you know, public venues and little elementary schools being shot, you know, with innocent kids, it started to affect me to where it's, like, this is not just a hood situation… This is an everyday situation. And we need to address this.”  This song, “No Guns Allowed”, is the message that Snoop Dogg wanted to portray to the United States and the world about gun control.</p>
